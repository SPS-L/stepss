# STEPSS

Umbrella repository for the **STEPSS** simulation platform ([stepss.sps-lab.org](https://stepss.sps-lab.org)). It pulls in every `stepss-*` component of the [SPS-L](https://github.com/SPS-L) organization as a git submodule, each tracking its default branch.

## Components

## Getting everything

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:SPS-L/stepss.git
```

or over HTTPS:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SPS-L/stepss.git
```

Submodule URLs are relative, so they use the same protocol you cloned the umbrella with. Private components require access to the SPS-L organization; without it they simply fail to fetch — initialize just the public ones with:

```sh
git submodule update --init stepss-uramses stepss-pyramses stepss-pyramses-doc \
  stepss-java-ui stepss-cg-studio stepss-eigenanalysis stepss-RamsesNN \
  stepss-docs stepss-userguide
```

## Updating to the latest components

Each submodule tracks its default branch. To move everything to the latest tips:

```sh
./update.sh
```

then review and commit the bumped submodule pointers:

```sh
git commit -am "Update components to latest"
git push
```

If you already cloned and someone else bumped the pointers:

```sh
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
